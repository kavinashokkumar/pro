            Spider-Man is a beloved superhero known for his agility, intelligence, and unwavering sense of responsibility. Created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko in 1962, he first appeared in Amazing Fantasy #15 and quickly became one of Marvel Comics’ most iconic characters. Peter Parker, the man behind the mask, was a shy, intelligent teenager from Queens, New York. After being bitten by a radioactive spider, he gained superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and a unique “spider-sense” that alerts him to danger. He designed his own web-shooters and costume, choosing to fight crime after the tragic death of his Uncle Ben—a moment that instilled in him the famous mantra:
            “With great power comes great responsibility.” Spider-Man balances his double life as a masked vigilante and a regular young man dealing with school, work, and relationships. His storylines often explore themes of sacrifice, morality, and perseverance. Over the years, he’s teamed up with groups like the Avengers and faced off against villains such as the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom.
            Whether swinging through skyscrapers or cracking jokes mid-battle, Spider-Man remains a symbol of hope and resilience for fans around the world.
